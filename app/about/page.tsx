            Hello üëã, I'm Lokesh!<br/> 
            A Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in backend development
            and microservices architecture. I specialize in designing and building  
            scalable, high-performance applications using Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
            and implementing robust, distributed systems.<br/>

            I thrive on solving complex programming challenges, optimizing 
            system efficiency, and ensuring high availability in production 
            environments. Passionate about system design, clean code, and 
            distributed architectures, I actively contribute to collaborative 
            teams, ensuring seamless integration and smooth project execution. <br/> 

            Always up for a challenge, I continuously push myself to enhance 
            backend architectures, improve system performance, and stay ahead
