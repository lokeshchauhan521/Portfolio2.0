              Hello ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Deepak, a Software Engineer with 2+ years of
              experience in frontend, micro-frontend, backend, and
              microservices. I enjoy solving complex programming challenges,
              staying ahead with the latest technologies, and building scalable,
